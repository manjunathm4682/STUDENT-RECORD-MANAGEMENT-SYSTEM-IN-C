# STUDENT-RECORD-MANAGEMENT-SYSTEM-IN-C
The Student Record Management System is a C-based application that utilizes fundamental data structures to manage student information.
This project implements a student record management system using C, designed to efficiently handle student information, including names, marks, and IDs. The system allows for the addition, deletion, search, and display of student records, making it a useful tool for managing small to medium-sized databases.

**Project Overview**<br>
The Student Record Management System is a C-based application that utilizes fundamental data structures to manage student information. It supports key operations such as adding new records, deleting existing ones, searching for specific student details, and displaying all stored records. The system focuses on managing the following student information:

Name, Marks, ID.

**Features**
<br>**Add Student Records**: Input and store student details like name, marks, and ID.
<br>
**Delete Student Records**: Remove a student’s record by their unique ID.
<br>
**Search for a Student**: Retrieve a student’s information by searching via their ID.
<br>
**Display All Records**: View all stored student records, including name, marks, and ID.

**Data Structures Used**<br>
(**Singly Linked List**): Used for dynamically managing student records, allowing for efficient insertion and deletion operations.

**How It Works**<br>
Adding Records: Users can add a new student record to the system, storing the student's name, marks, and ID in a singly linked list.
Deleting Records: Users can delete a record by providing the student's ID, which removes the corresponding node from the singly linked list.
Searching Records: The system allows users to search for a specific student by ID, displaying the student's name and marks if found.
Displaying Records: Users can view all student records currently stored in the system, with each student's details neatly organized.
